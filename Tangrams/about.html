    <h1>Ten Grams of Tangrams</h1>
    <h3>by Owen Gebhardt</h3>
    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p>A game about finding the quickest way to fit angular shapes snugly onto a board.</p>

    </div>

    <p>It'll be a puzzle game, and no real-time reactions will be required.</p>

    <p>I'm planning on this being desktop-friendly at the very least, but I think it should be able to support mobile devices fairly easily too.</p>

    <p>No story, just nice-looking arrangements of tiles :)</p>

    <p>Visuals will be very simple flat-color polygons (or maybe with wood or metal textures if I can get those working). I'm hoping to make it visually simple and zen-like.</p>

    <p>Gameplay will consist of moving pieces onto the board by clicking (or tapping) and dragging them. Players must also rotate pieces by pressing rotate buttons that appear to either side of a selected piece. Those already familiar with jigsaw puzzles and similar space-filling brainteasers should find these moves natural.</p>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>

    <p>Hiii! I'm Owen, a Game Design and Development major at RIT. As I'm writing this, I'm a sophomore. I'm skilled with art done physically or in free programs like Krita and GIMP, and pretty skilled with programming in languages like C#, JavaScript, Java, and Scratch, but all aspects of game development interest me too.</p>

    <h1>Documentation</h1>

    <p>Once again, I had a lot of fun with this project! It was a lot of work but it was fun to put it all together in the end.</p>

    <p>When brainstorming ideas for this project, I thought about playing with tangrams as a kid. Tangrams are a set of angular shapes, typically a very specific selection, which can be pieced together to form larger silhouettes. I realized that it might be fun to make a game that randomly generates tangrams for the player to place on a grid, like a jigsaw puzzle where the difficulty isn't fitting those little knobs on the pieces together the right way, but fitting the whole pieces themselves together.</p>

    </div>

    <p>I knew from the get-go that to make my system for putting shapes on the board as general as possible, I'd need some sort of way to store tile data in an abstract form. The first way I thought of for doing this was arrays, and I spent a while just figuring out how one of those could store triangles instead of the rectangles that 2D arrays are made for.</p>
    <p>After a few different prototype ideas, the method I thought up to work with them in the simplest way possible was to just store the position of each triangular "tile" as an element in a 3D array. The first two dimensions represent the row and column of a standard 2D array of squares, but each of those elements has an additional array inside it for storing the states of two triangles each. The diagonal running down the middle of each triangle would have its direction determined by a checkerboard-ish pattern across the whole game board, stored as what I call the tile's "parity" because of its relation to evenness and oddness.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Another thing I realized was that while it would be important to store the game board's tiles in a nested array structure, so I could access each one by index, it would also be really helpful to have the game pieces store their tiles serially so I could focus on only the tiles that were contained in that piece. To solve this, I store collections of tiles in the game as either a Grid or a List. Grids lay out the tiles they contain in a big array, with each element containing a value to represent the presence or absence of a tile at that position. Lists instead store a list of coordinates representing the Grid locations of only the tiles present in the collection. I went on to make a whole ton of methods just for manipulating data in these special structures, most of which are in the utilities.js helper file.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>After solving how the tangrams would be stored, I needed to find a way to render these structures on the screen. I fulfilled my ES6 class requirement by implementing these objects so they could be stored, rendered, and moved easily. The classes I made are Tangram, an abstract parent class with functions for manipulating and rendering a collection of tiles; Piece, which is meant to be moved around and placed on the board, storing its tile info in a list for easy transfer; and Board, which acts as a stationary holder for many Pieces, storing tile info in a grid for easy acccess, as well as an array of all Pieces placed on it.</p>

    <p>One of the more challenging parts of this project was figuring out how to generate Pieces given an empty Board so they'd all fit in. Since I wanted all Pieces to be contiguous, I ended up creating a method to find the spots adjacent to a given coordinate on the Board. The process involves taking a board with all full cells and gradually picking either a tile on the Board to act as the seed for a new Piece, or taking a random tile adjacent to those in the Piece being built and tacking them on. Also, "adjacent" doesn't feel like a word anymore.</p>

    <p>Due to the basic functionality taking so long, I couldn't get all the things I wanted for this project implemented, so I ended up leaving out the highscore tracker, progressively increasing board sizes, undo and restart buttons, a list of all the boards you've completed, and even being able to rotate pieces. At least it doesn't throw any errors that I know of though!</p>

    <p>But there's still a bunch of extra features I did implement that I'm proud of, though! I'm pretty happy with how non-intrusive the UI is, and how things appear as you need them and disappear when you don't. I also think the random colors look pretty good on the tiles (well, sometimes). Take note as well of how the most recently-clicked piece always appears at the top of a stack of Pieces. Finally, all three sounds you can hear were recorded by me! I recorded myself clacking a few small objects together with my laptop's mic using the program Audacity.</p>

    <p>I think this is a project I'm overall quite happy with, and I hope I can continue to develop it further in the future.</p>
