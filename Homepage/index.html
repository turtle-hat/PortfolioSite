                        This site was originally made as a project for my Intro to Game Web Technology course in Fall 2022. I figure the site itself is worth mentioning as an example of something I've made.

                    <p>
                        The site changes responsively to fit different screen sizes. If the text in each section would become too squeezed by the images, the images are allowed to stretch over the whole width of the content box. Next, if the sidebars (and aside elements in those sidebars) would become too squeezed, the content box expands to fill most of the screen width, and asides are moved into the main flow of the content under their respective sections.

                        flexbox in turn contains two smaller images. There's also a paragraph element for the caption,
                        and finally everything's wrapped in a div and floated to the side.</p>

                <p>This is a project I made in my Interactive Media Development class, in which we learn how to use the video game engine Unity.</p>
                <blockquote class="excerpt">
                    <p>In <strong>Arrow Ace</strong>, you play an ace pilot/archer who wields a versatile<strong>bow</strong> that can shoot many kinds of projectiles. If you get an enemy's projectile to hits the direct <strong>center</strong> of your plane, you <strong>grab</strong> it instead of letting it deal damage. The next time you hit the fire button, you'll launch that <strong>stolen projectile</strong> instead of a normal arrow.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This took me around a month to program. I also made all the art assets myself (with the exception of the fonts). I added a number of notable features that weren't required, like the ship having acceleration and slowdown times and objects having multiple hitboxes for detecting different gameplay conditions.</p>
                <p>There are two types of enemies: One type waits until you pass in front of it before charging at you, and the other type fires spear projectiles at you. Health is handled with a health bar that depletes when you get hit. Scoring is based on enemy hits and kills, and the amount of points each individual enemy gives out can be doubled (sometimes multiple times) by hitting it in the fuselage or with a special projectile.</p>
                <p>There's currently a bug where the UI is too small and the Game Over overlay shows up at all times and in the wrong place on the screen, but this is an issue with the build of the game; in the Unity editor this problem doesn't occur.</p>

                    <p>For the first phase of this project's development, The first phase of the development of this site was actually copying another layout from a print source into electronic HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>The original source was the first page of an article by web developer Ivan Pope. It featured multiple different styles of text, a grid-based layout, and a three-column structure for the article's text, and overlapping images of multiple sizes. I thought it would be a fun but not-too-difficult layout to try and copy. It sure was fun, but boy was it harder than I thought!</p>
                    <p>This layout doesn't feature any responsiveness, since it was made at a fixed width to get the proportions as close to the source as possible.</p>

                    <h2>Font hunt</h2>
                    <p>One of the more unexpectedly difficult parts of this part of the project was finding fonts that were similar to the ones in the original source. For instance, I found the font Gill Sans was used for most of the non-copy text, but I found out it needed a paid license to use. To avoid spending money on the project, I ended up using the free lookalike webfont Cabin instead.</p>
