            <p>A lighthearted, cartoonish courtroom visual novel game based on the Ace Attorney series, with a variety of custom systems for managing all aspects of gameplay and the user interface, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2D character animations.</li>
                <li>Input polling with keyboard and touchscreen support.</li>
                <li>Text display with format markup, soft wrapping, and inline commands for signalling cinematic events.</li>
                <li>Vertically layered soundtrack coordination.</li>
                <li>User interface with animations.</li>
                <li>Visual effects.</li>
                <li>2D camera motions.</li>
                <li>Nonlinear scene flow control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Development has been ongoing since 2022, when free time allows. Currently, I am in the process of illustrating final art assets, including backgrounds, character animations, and interface elements. I have also hired a composer to write the game's original soundtrack and regularly coordinate with him to ensure it fits the desired tone for various story beats.</p>
            <p>Avocado Attorney is an open source project programmed in the block-based programming language Scratch using the TurboWarp IDE, with well-documented code systems designed to allow non-programmers to engage in communal storytelling by scripting their own game sequences in my custom engine and sharing their creations online.</p>
