        <h1>Project 2 Documentation</h1>

        <a href="index.html">Click here to return to the main site.</a>

        <p>This project was a lot of fun (if I severely underestimated how long it would take) and I think I got something pretty impressive out of it.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="media/ScratchProposal.png" alt="Original concept sketch of the website's layout">
            <figcaption>Here's a mockup of what the website was planned to look like at the proposal phase of design. It's considerably different from the final product, and some features like the generation ruler at the top didn't make the cut, but it served as a solid proof of concept.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As Nick might remember, I was originally going to use the Giphy API instead, since the Scratch API doesn't actually support CORS! I drew a little mockup for how I wanted to improve that here:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="media/GiphyProposal.png" alt="Concept sketch for an improved version of the Giphy Finder homework">
            <figcaption>Here was the original Giphy plan! I wanted it to be less intended for straight browsing of GIFs and more intended for picking out a list of GIFs which you could share all at once with your friends.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Thankfully, I was able to follow along with the PHP resources posted in myCourses to get my AJAX needs fully functioning!</p>

        <p>The first thing I worked on was just accessing the JSON returned by my various PHP requests. After that, I came up with a system to recursively request remixes of a project, and after that I just added the relevant returned data for each project into an object, which I could use to build the tree itself.</p>
        
        <p>As you might be able to see from the concept art, I originally planned on having all the projects inside one big grid, but I found it far easier to add each project as its own nested flexbox.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="media/TreeConcept1.png" alt="Early prototype screenshot of project thumbnails scattered across the tree diagram.">
            <figcaption>The earliest visual proof of concept for the tree's layout. There are currently no border lines to show ancestry.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>From there, I decided to mainly focus on getting all the settings and interface working and looking nice.</p>

        <p>After that, I tidied up the tree by adding borders around remix groups. I'd played around with the idea a little before this, since I didn't want to bit the bullet and figure out how to get individually-drawn lines working, and eventually I realized that by removing the end edge of the border box and thickening the start edge it formed a sort of bracket shape which looks pleasing and expresses relationships well over long distances without looking too cluttered most of the time.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="media/TreeConcept2.png" alt="Concept sketch of final planned tree design">
            <figcaption>The mostly-finalized format for remixes in the tree. From here I would just tweak the padding, margin, and border widths, as well as creating other style variants for making the tree grow in different directions.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I'm particularly proud of the expanded project information boxes that appear when hovering over a project. It took a while to figure out how to get that to display without being disruptive, and I'm glad I landed on a solution that feels natural while not requiring an explicit click (unless on a tablet). I'm also happy with how I was able to change the direction of the tree just by swapping out to a different view just by swapping out the stylesheet governing which the axes of the flexboxes in it.</p>

        <p>One last thing to mention is how data is stored. Remixes are stored as objects nested inside a main object, and are accessed by using their project ID as a key, making it easy to locate information about a project (and its child remixes, which are stored in a list that gets dynamically filled as more remixes are added). Having a centralized object keep track of it all proved to be a robust and easily-used solution for accessing info on one project relative to others, which was essential for corralling all the asynchronous, isolated XHR jobs running at once.</p>

        <p>Here's some miscellaneous sources I used to learn how to code parts of the site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-select-box/">JavaScriptTutorial.net - Help with formatting Select input elements</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs - Help with understanding a variety of JavaScript features, including arrays and object serialization</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp">W3Schools - Sample code for floating tooltips</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm hoping to eventually work on this more to make it more useful and easy to use. Some features I'd like to add but didn't get to are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storing already-loaded remix info in localStorage</li>
            <li>Next and previous page buttons when number of remixes shown is less than the number that actually exist</li>
            <li>Options to sort projects by release date, views, loves, favorites, and remixes</li>
            <li>A way to zoom the tree out and in so you can see the whole thing better</li>
            <li>Ability to search the Scratch API by a keyword, then put that into the Remix Tree Visualizer (suggested by Nick during our Feedback Party)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since this project fulfills all the requirements on the rubric, and it's something unique that I'm quite proud of, I'd like to say I think this project would be deserving of a 100%. That said, I know I'm submitting this 47 hours late, which I would understand if points were taken off for. I didn't request an extension because I didn't think I'd need it, but evidently, well, I sure could've used one. I think considering how late it is, an 80% (subtracting 10 percentage points every day, a trend I've seen in many previous courses) would be a fair grade, despite my wishes that it could score better.</p>
